# Marketing-Campaign-Analysis


As a data analyst working at a shopping mall, I was tasked with conducting a comprehensive analysis of various paid marketing campaigns at our mall. The primary objective of this analysis was to determine the effectiveness of paid campaigns and whether the costs outweighed the benefits reaped. My ultimate target was to equip the marketing team with actionable insights that would inform their decision-making process for future campaigns.

## Dataset
The shopping mall dataset contains details of a 5-month paid search campaign crafted to promote the mall and drive engagement through paid search coupons and promo codes. 40 distinct types of ads were used for promotion.

## Tools
For the creation of this dashboard, I used Power BI.

## Business Questions
1. Which ad groups have the highest number of clicks and impressions?
2. What is the CTR for various ad groups?
3. How do conversions vary across different months?
4. What group has the highest conversion rate?
5. How does the amount spent on advertising compare to the revenue generated per month?
6. Is the revenue generated from the ad groups more or less than the amount spent?
